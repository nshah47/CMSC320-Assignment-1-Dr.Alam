Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: I'm personally very interested in the intersection of healthcare and tech. As a result, I believe data science would be very beneficial to that field. A specific example of how it may be useful is monitoring disease outbreaks and rates.
